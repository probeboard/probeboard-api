# probeboard-api documentation

Documentation that belongs **with the code**: it would go stale if the code
changed and nobody updated it, so it is reviewed in the same pull request as
the change that affects it.

| Document                                 | Covers                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| [../README.md](../README.md)             | Running, developing, configuring, the layout and its rules |
| [m0-verification.md](m0-verification.md) | What was executed to accept M0 and what it produced        |

## What is not here

Design and thesis material lives in
[probeboard-docs](https://github.com/Levon0Asatryan/probeboard-docs), because it
would still be true if this backend were rewritten in another language.

| Why probeboard exists, what is in scope       | chapters 1 and 5 |
| What "API health" means, the formulas         | chapter 3        |
| How other systems solve this                  | chapter 4        |
| User stories and acceptance criteria          | chapter 6        |

| What is built next                            | chapter 8        |
| Why a decision was made                       | `en/adr/`        |

The rule deciding which side a document goes on is
[ADR-0009](https://github.com/Levon0Asatryan/probeboard-docs/blob/main/en/adr/0009-docs-split.md).

## Adding a document here

Only if it answers _how_, for someone who has this repository checked out, and
would be wrong if the code changed without it. Reference material — API
endpoints, database schema — should be **generated** from the code rather than
written, so it cannot drift.
