/**
 * Authentication rate limiting (NFR-14, A-6).
 *
 * Two limits, because A-6 describes two threats:
 *
 * - **by IP**, counting every attempt, against one host hammering the endpoint.
 * - **by email**, counting only failures, against credential stuffing at one
 *   account from many hosts. An attacker with a botnet defeats the IP limit
 *   entirely, and this is the one that stops them.
 *
 * Counters live in PostgreSQL rather than in memory so they survive a restart
 * — otherwise an attacker simply waits for a deploy — and so a second api
 * instance shares them. That is also why `@nestjs/throttler` was not used: its
 * default storage is in-process.
 *
 * Admission and recording are one atomic operation. Checking and then
 * recording as separate steps let a parallel burst through: measured, twenty
 * concurrent attempts were admitted against a cap of five. Stuffing arrives in
 * parallel, so that race removed the protection entirely.
