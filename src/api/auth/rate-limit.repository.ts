   * Decides and records in one transaction.

   * Counting and then inserting as two steps is a read-modify-write on shared
   * state: concurrent requests all read a count below the limit and all
   * proceed. Measured before this was written — twenty parallel attempts were
   * admitted against a cap of five, so the limiter did nothing against the one
   * threat it exists for, since credential stuffing arrives in parallel.
   *
   * A transaction alone is not enough under READ COMMITTED, because each
   * transaction's count cannot see another's uncommitted insert. The advisory
   * lock is what serialises callers that share a key; callers with different
   * keys never contend.
   *
   * The attempt is recorded pessimistically as a failure. An in-flight attempt
   * counts against the limit until proven otherwise, which is the correct bias
   * — it fails closed.
